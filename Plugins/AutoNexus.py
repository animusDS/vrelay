"""
This is a plugin that will automatically nexus for you when, upon taking damage, your HP falls below a certain threshold.

Current functionality:
- Able to predict future HP before the server updates.
- Compensates for server not having processed all PlayerHits
- Accounts for most AoE's except for enemies with 2+ same color throws. Currently looks at max damaging per color x enemyType (overly safe - see Revil's AOEs)

TODO:
- re vit formula
- add healing, bleeding
- maybe add in lifesteal
