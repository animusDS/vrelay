# vrelay

A man-in-the-middle proxy server for the Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) private server Valor. Features packet editing/hooking, a framework to write custom plugins, and many QoL plugins such as predictive autonexus.

## How to use

1. Install Python 64-bit. You can find installations of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Install the 64-bit version or the GUI will not work.
2. Navigate to the right side of this page and look for `Releases`. Click on the latest release and download from `vrelay-v3.2.6.zip`. 
   - You can also clone this repository.
3. There is a folder called `normal` which contains the `Valor.swf` file for the normal server. Replace the original `Valor.swf` downloaded from Valor's website with the `Valor.swf` in this folder.
     - This `.swf` file has been modded so you can connect to the proxy server. If you only see `Valor`, that means you have your file extensions off.
4. Open the command line (type `Win âŠž + r` and type in `cmd`, press enter. the command line will now be open), `cd` into the folder containing the code.
    - This will involve typing `cd C:\path\to\folder` then pressing enter. **Note**: you need to replace `C:\path\to\folder` with your path to vrelay.
    - If you downloaded the hack in another drive, such as `Z:` or `D:`, then you need to type the drive name (`Z:` or `D:`, respectively) in order to tell command prompt you wish to be in that drive.
5. Once you're in the folder in the command prompt, type `python proxy.py` in the command line to start the proxy. If you have previously installed Python, also try `py proxy.py` or `python3 proxy.py` if this does not work.
6. Connect to the proxy server in the server list and you're good to go.

## Features

Watch this video for a demonstration of some vrelay features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9N08Xuop4g

**Toggles**

Each feature has a toggle key as shown in the image above.

1. **Predictive Autonexus**: If you take damage that will put you under a certain threshold, you automatically join the nexus.
    - Accounts for most AoE's except for enemies with 2+ same color throws.
2. **Godmode**: Immune to all bullet and ground damage. Does not block AoE damage.
3. **No projectile**: Hides all projectiles from appearing; essentially another godmode (but very obvious to others as you do not know where to dodge).
    - Does not hide AoE damage (you will still take damage from AoE). 
4. **Speedy**: Apply speedy to yourself!
5. **Swiftness**: Apply swiftness (stronger form of Speedy) to yourself! Stacks with Speedy.
6. **Remove client-side debuffs**: This will remove client-side debuffs one tick after they are applied. These will not remove server-sided debuffs like bleeding, quiet, etc.
7. **Challenge/Normal mode**: This button (in the bottom right corner) will toggle between the proxy connecting to the challenge server or normal server.

**Player commands**

- `/dep`: deposit all potions into your potion storage. Can use this in any map.
- `/an #`: set autonexus % between 0 and 99. Enter only integers.
    - `/an help` in game to see the syntax.
- `/safe`: disable all commands shown above and autonexus messages.
